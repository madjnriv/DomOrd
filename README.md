# DomOrd (Domus Ordinis)

An offline-first, local AI knowledge system. Import documents, transcripts, and web content, and query them with retrieval-augmented Q&A, summaries, contradiction detection, and flashcard generation — with no cloud dependency.

## Overview

DomOrd (Domus Ordinis) is a personal knowledge engine that runs entirely on the user's own machine. Content is parsed, chunked, embedded, and indexed locally, and every query is answered by retrieving relevant context from the user's own library before generating a response. Nothing leaves the device by default.

The name comes from Latin: Domus, meaning house or home, reflects that knowledge stays within its own domain. Ordinis, from ordo, meaning order, reflects the system's role in organizing unstructured content into structured, retrievable knowledge.

## Core Features

- Import PDFs, notes, transcripts, and webpages
- Local parsing, chunking, embedding, and indexing — no cloud dependency
- Ask questions across the full knowledge base
- Generate summaries from imported content
- Surface contradictions between sources
- Generate flashcards from stored knowledge

## Architecture Overview

DomOrd (Domus Ordinis) is built as a microservice architecture on Node.js with NestJS. The system separates the ingestion path (parsing, chunking, embedding, and writing to storage) from the retrieval path (embedding a query, running similarity search, and generating a response), so each can be reasoned about and scaled independently.
